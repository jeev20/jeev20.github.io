Thanks to [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [p10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) projects!\n\n* Standard directory view\n   ![ZSHP10K](images/zshp10k.png)\n\n* Standard git directory and virtualenv\n   ![zshp10kVenv](images/zshp10kVenv.png)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSome years ago I had tested the `zsh` terminal and the Powerlevel10K theme to go with it, but for reasons unknown I did not use it actively. In recent times, my time within the terminal has increased, hence it was time to make the terminal look a little prettier than the standard `bash` terminal.  \n\n### Installation script\n\nThe script below installs the `zsh` terminal and installs the [powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. We also need to install the [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) project. Finally, the `zsh` terminal is set as the default terminal. This last part requires `sudo` permissions/authentication and cannot be completed unattended.\n```{.bash}\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo apt install zsh\ncd\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k\necho 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k\nchsh -s /bin/zsh\n\n```\n\n`p10k configure` can then be used to configure the terminal as one pleases. This runs the configuration wizard.\n\n![p10kconfigure](images/p10kconfigure.png)\n\n\n\nPlugins used in `.zshrc` are independent of the options chosen in the `p10k configure`. For example, I needed the auto suggestions in ohmyzsh, python environment and pip zsh plugins. Installing plugins is a simple as setting the following line in the `.zshrc` file. Here is a list of [available plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) from [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) project.\n\n```plaintext \n.zshrc\n....\nplugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting pipenv pip)\n...\n```\n\n### Customized p10K configure \nMy p10k options are: *awesome-fontconfig, large icons, rainbow, unicode, 24h time, blurred heads, blurred tails, 2 lines, solid, full frame, light-ornaments, sparse, many icons, fluent, instant_prompt=verbose.*\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nIn the last step of the configuration wizard, the `.zshrc` file is updated with the selected options. \n\nRemember that the `.zshrc` and `.p10k.zsh` files are overwritten by default. So backup them before running `p10K configure`. \n:::\n\n \n \n### Contents of my .zshrc and .p10k.zsh\n\n### [.zshrc gist](https://gist.github.com/jeev20/77f1ae86f5a9e6709ddd5398dbfbc96f)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jeev20/77f1ae86f5a9e6709ddd5398dbfbc96f.js\"></script>\n\n### [.p10k.zsh gist](https://gist.github.com/jeev20/a5fecd61b8ce9b985bae88095374e05d)\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jeev20/a5fecd61b8ce9b985bae88095374e05d.js\"></script>\n\n",
