Using RAG or Prompt engineering for a text extraction usecase does not work well either. For a contextual text extraction usecase there are currently four possible ways with their advantages and disadvantages. \n\n**1. Prompt engineering to get the base llm to reply with json strings**\n\n  This approach is to write very precise prompts (system and user prompts) and try to force the base model to generate responses similar to the required format. This works very poorly for edgecases. \n\n**2. Using retrival augmented generation (RAG)**\n\n  Although a great way to build context aware systems, RAG is rather poorly suited when the content of the entire text has to be read to extract required text. RAG can ignore parts of the document if the query engine is not robust, if not all relevant text is extracted, then we may not parse the important part of the input text.  \n\n**3. Prompt engineering + structured output using pydantic class of the required output**\n\n  Here we combine both prompt engineering and force the model to only return required response. Pydantic classes define the output schema, which also validates if the generated response. This is the second best way to create text extraction workflows using llms. \n\n\n\n**4. Instruction based fine-tuning the base llm model** ‚≠ê\n  \n  Here we take a small part of the model and retrain that part with our custom dataset, which resembles our real usecase. In addition, after fine-tuning, we are not bound to create detailed system or user prompts. The fine-tuned model already would have learnt to extract relevant fields. A pydantic class can still be used to validated the generated output, but we would have fundamentally changed the output\n\n# Approach\nIn past two weeks, I have been exploring the field of fine-tuning of large language models using various SOTA frameworks. I have explored fine-tuning using [unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/), [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) and [axolotl](https://axolotl.ai/). I found axolotl to be quite complex but it had ability to distribute training across multiple GPUs. Transformers module was second most complex as there were many different approaches which could be used in this library. \n\nI finally settled with Unsloth, clearly because it was easy to start with and had many turnkey jupyter notebooks to use. That said, a big negative is that the api for multi-gpu fine-tuning is still not roboust enough in 2025. Without a hefty GPU on my [LLM server](https://jeev20.github.io/posts/buildingapowerfulenoughlocalaiserver/), unsloth would just keep crashing with the usual `cuda out of memory` error. I previously had two RTX 3060 each with 12 Gb VRAM. \n\nMy server now is upgraded with a RTX 3090 which has a massive 24GB of Vram. This opened up many oppurtunities to learn fine-tuning of llm using unsloth. I finally understood and implemented fine-tuned model on a reallife use case. The model I learnt fine-tuning on was phi4 by microsoft and modified by Unsloth which also works well for structured output generation. The idea was to implement a task-specific tuning for a usecase at work. \n\nI studied the jupyter notebook from [unsloth showing fine-tuning of phi4 model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Phi_4-Conversational.ipynb#scrollTo=AX734MS139kk) and modified parts of it. \n\n# Synthetic data creation\n\n::: {.callout}\n\nTo ensure my training data had good volume and variation, I used Google's **Gemini Pro 2.5** to help create a python script to programatically generate synthetic data with a given format. \n\n:::\n\nThese key-value pairs would then be used to fine-tune the model.  \nI choose to keep things simple and opted for a well known `jsonl`format. `jsonl` format is similar to `json` but each line is a valid `json` string without an trailing comma.\n\nTo create a look-alike dataset I used the `faker` module in python and created the `jsonl` file programatically. This allows me to scale the training dataset to any number I wish. For example, to create 10000 datapoints, I use the following command:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>synthetic_data_generator.py</summary>\n\n```{.python}\nimport json\nimport random\nimport argparse\nfrom

we started with Phi4 model and now fine-tuned it to only respond with a json string which we want. Another advantage is that I did not need to specify a system or a user prompt to get the correct structured output. \n\nI can use this learning to replicate the same process to any open-source LLM (text to text). I now want to learn fine-tuning of other modals, starting with image-to-text LLM fine-tuning.  \n\n\n\n\n{{< embed _phi4_FineTuningCustomData.ipynb >}}\n\n",
