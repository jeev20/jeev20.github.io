In this case it mines for bitcoin by pooling together large number of such boards. \n\nThe cool part about this setup is that it sips power in comparison to the state-of-the-art bitcoin miners. The ESP32's I have probably use 160 mA per board, which is negligible in the grand scheme of things. \n\nThat said, the chances of finding a block on a hardware this weak is next to 0! Therefore, some call it a bitcoin lottery. \n\nThe hardware setup is quite simple as shown below. A cluster of 4 ESP32 Wroom boards connected to a powered USB hub. \n\nThe software is quite easy to flash onto the ESP32. The [post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466940.0) and [website](https://flasher.bitronics.store/) goes over the flashing process. \n\n\n```{mermaid}\n\ngraph TD\n\n    subgraph ESP32_Cluster\n    direction TB\n        Esp1[<img src='https://no.mouser.com/images/espressifsystems/lrg/ESP32-DevKitC-32E_SPL.jpg' width='40' height='150'/>] \n\n        Esp2[<img src='https://no.mouser.com/images/espressifsystems/lrg/ESP32-DevKitC-32E_SPL.jpg' width='40' height='150'/>]\n\n\n        Esp3[<img src='https://no.mouser.com/images/espressifsystems/lrg/ESP32-DevKitC-32E_SPL.jpg' width='40' height='150'/>] \n\n        Esp4[<img src='https://no.mouser.com/images/espressifsystems/lrg/ESP32-DevKitC-32E_SPL.jpg' width='40' height='150'/>] \n\n\n    end \n\n\n\n    Powered_USB_Hub\n\n \nESP32_Cluster-->Powered_USB_Hub\n\n\n```\n\nQuite happy with how it runs. \n\n![OutputVSCodeExtension](images/ESP32Cluster.png)\n\n",
