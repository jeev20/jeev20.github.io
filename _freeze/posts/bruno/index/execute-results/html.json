To my surprise, Postman has now fully gone the cloud way and syncs all collections to the cloud. \n\nThis means that if I somehow forgot to remove my tokens or credentials, they can potential be synced to Postman servers!\n\nThe scratchpad within Postman is also limited now and is next to useless. I did also try insomnia, and it seems they too have fallen for the same honeypot!\n\nThere has to be a better API client, and my search today ended with bruno.\n\n## [bruno](https://www.usebruno.com) \nA great alternative to postman or insomnia. \n\nbruno is written in electron the same framework used by Visual Studio Code and the code is open-source with a MIT license.  \n\nThe founders [manifesto](https://www.usebruno.com/manifesto) is a treat to read for any open-source enthusiast. \n\nBruno is offered both as a free version and a paid version.\n\n\nThe paid version cost `$19` for 2 machines for a span of 2 years. After which the renewal is set to 60% of the `$19` to cover development of the project. The feature set is great for my use-case and I admire Anoop's honesty. I bought the Golden Edition (Individual License) today (2.6.2024)\n\n::: {.callout}\n\nI wish bruno and Anoop great success. It is so refreshing to see when a great product meets a transparent and simple founder. \n\n::: \n\nHere are some YouTube videos to get started with bruno.\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3F6Gu7tG8M >}}\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bSMFpbcPiY >}}\n\n",
