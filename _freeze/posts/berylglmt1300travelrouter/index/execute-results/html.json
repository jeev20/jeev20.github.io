Everything went as planned, the remote wifi (hotel wi-fi) was connected to the travel router. Via the toggle switch the Tailscale client was started and all my devices connected to the travel router at the remote location without any hiccups.\n\nOverall, I am quite satisfied with the performance of this tiny travel router and this certainly will be a part of my future travels. I would happily recommend this to my contacts. \n\n",
