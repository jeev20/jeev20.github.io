This to either fresh install or reinstall OS on windows, linux, mac and on raspberrypi computers. However, in 2024 I came to know of a tool called [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)! This could have saved me a lot of time and effort in the past. \n\nVentoy is a open source tool to create bootable usb drives which supports images in ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI formats. \n\nUnlike traditional way of creating an USB bootable drive for each OS image, a Ventoy USB drive can contain all different kind of OS images in one pendrive. It can even organize them as you wish. On boot, you are greeted with a simple GUI where you get the option to choose the image you want to boot into.\n\nI went from using over 8 pendrives to just 1. The simplicity it has brought in my \"distro-hopping\" workflow is just bliss. I have organized the images files as shown below.\n\n\n```\nVentoyDrive  \n│\n└───Windows\n│   │   Windows 10\n│   │   Windows 11\n│   \n└───Linux\n    │   Ubuntu 22.4\n    │   Ubuntu 24.4\n    │   Kubuntu.24.4\n    │   PopOS 22.4\n    │   LMDE 6\n    │   LinuxMint 21.3\n    │   Proxmox 8.2\n    │   Gparted\n    |   MxLinux\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nAnother great feature of ventoy is that in addition to the OS image files, you are free to use the Ventoy USB drive as a normal USB drive. \n\nWith a large enough pendrive, ventoy can act as both a bootable usb drive and a regular usb storage device.
