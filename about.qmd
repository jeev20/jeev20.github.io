Hello, I'm Jeevith. I love automation and am currently working to be a creative data scientist. My experience spans across the field of technical safety, underwater robotics, process/test automation and data analysis. 


This website is an effort to document my journey of learning new technologies. 


I plan to write about topics shown in the mindmap, which will also expand with new learnings.
