Hello, I'm Jeevith. I love automation and currently working my way into the Data Science field. My expierence spans across the field of technical safety, underwater robotics, process/test automation and data science. 


This website is an effort to document my journey of learning new technologies. 

After many years of working as a developer, I missed having a repository where I could document and access my learnings. I also hope that by sharing my know-how, I can help others along the way. 


The plan is to write about topics covered in this mindmap, which will expand with new learnings.
